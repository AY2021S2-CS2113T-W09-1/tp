## Overview of Finux

---
Finux is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that allows you to record your expenses, savings and loans all
in one consolidated platform. With these information made readily available at your fingertips, it will allow you to
better adjust your expenditure or work harder towards your savings goal. Finux also includes a way for you to keep
track of the loans you have made to your friends, or the tabs for the dinners you have paid for first.

As the Finux application is inspired entirely by the *Nix operating systems, and if you are familiar with the CLI
command interface, you will definitely enjoy the benefits of the application. You will also be able to speed up your
financial management and planning with the Finux application as compared to the traditional finance management
applications in the market.
