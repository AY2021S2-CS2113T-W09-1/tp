## 1. Introduction

---

Finux is a CLI Style application that allows the user to make better financial
decisions based on the information recorded in the application. If you are familiar
with the CLI command interface, you will enjoy the benefits of speeding up your
financial management with Finux rather than using the traditional management system.


## 2. Quick Start

---

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `finux.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-W09-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* of Finux.
4. For Windows users, pull up your **Command Prompt**.\
   For Mac users, pull up your **Terminal**.\
   Navigate to the directory containing the `finux.jar` file.\
   i.e. `cd FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is the absolute address to the home folder of Finux.
5. Run the `finux.jar` file by executing the command `java -jar finux.jar`.

---

> üí° **Explanation for Command formats:**
>> Commands in Finux follow these argument orders (depending on the command):
>> * `CMD -OPT <FIELD> [-OPT <FIELD>...]`
>> * `CMD -OPT`
>> * `CMD { -OPT_1 ... | -OPT_2 ... | ... } ...`
>> * `CMD <FIELD>`
>> * `CMD [<FIELD>]`
>> * `CMD`
>
>> Argument types and notation:\
>> `CMD` - a valid command.\
>> `-OPT` - an option, a letter preceded by a dash. E.g. "-i".\
>> `<FIELD>` - an area where data is required.\
>> `[...]` - optional argument(s).\
>> `{ ... | ... | ... }` - mutually exclusive arguments,
>> * e.g. `{ -e | -l | -s }` means that `view -e -s` has a conflict with options `-e` and `-s`.
>
> ‚ùó **Commands and options are case-sensitive:**\
> E.g. `exit` will work, whereas `Exit`, `EXIT` or other variations
> will not be recognised.\
> E.g. `view -s` will work, but using `-S` will not be recognised as
> a valid option.

> üí° **Date and Date formats:**
>> Date input is required when you specify the option `-d`.\
>> You are required enter a date that follows a valid Date format.\
>> Finux supports multiple Date formats, for ease of use:
>> * `DDMMYYYY`
>> * `D.M.YYYY`
>> * `D-M-YYYY`
>> * `D/M/YYYY`
>> * `YYYY.M.D`
>> * `YYYY-M-D`
>> * `YYYY/M/D`
>>
>> üìù `today` keyword specifies today's date, replacing the need for you to type in the actual date for date inputs.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q1**: How can I transfer my saved tasks information to another computer?
> Run Finux on the other computer and overwrite the empty `finux.txt` created, with the `finux.txt` that
> contains the data of your previous Finux usage.

> No. `view -l` only shows the total amount of unreturned loans.

**Q3**: What happens if FINUX crashes unexpectedly? <br>
> All records are saved upon addition, deletion or returned, so no worries!

**Q4**: FINUX keeps having a `bad init` error message, but it is my first time launching FINUX. <br>
> Do check and ensure that FINUX has the proper write permissions in the directory.
