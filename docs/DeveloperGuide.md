## 1. Introduction

---

**Greetings from Finux!**

**Finux** is a CLI Style application that allows the user to make better financial
decisions based on the information recorded in the application. If you’re familiar
with the CLI command interface, you will enjoy the benefit of speeding up your
finance management rather than using the traditional management system.

**Finux** is written in Java 11 and uses the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
OOP enables us to produce organized and reusable codes, allowing efficient improvements
and revisions in the future.

### 1.1 Purpose

This guide is for new and current developers of **Finux**. It describes the overall architecture
design of **Finux** and describes the current implementation details of our main features
with the thought process behind each of them. The current edition of this guide is meant for
the `v2.1` release.

### 1.2 Using this Guide

Throughout the guide, you might encounter several icons, refer to the following consolidate
list of icons:

> 💡 It indicates that this is an important piece of information.\
> ❗  It indicates that this is a warning and you should be aware of it while developing.\
> 📝 It indicates that this is a tip and you may find it useful when using our application or guide.

> 📝 Text that are blue like this [example(jumps to 1.2)](#12-using-this-guide), are clickable links
> that will move you to the relevant section of the guide.

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|user|be able to add a record (expense) with dates|record each expense into the app.|
|v1.0|clumsy user|be able to delete wrong inputs|easily rectify errors in the record list.|
|v1.0|debt collector (Student)|list down a list of people who owes me money with a deadline|make sure that they return their money.|
|v1.0|student|list each and every incurred expense|better manage my daily/weekly expenses.|
|v1.0|SOC student|have a CLI style money management system|accomplish tasks faster typing on a CLI compared to clicking on a GUI.|
|v1.0|user|be able to view the total expenditure, saving and loan credit|know the total amount of each category for planning and viewing.|
|v1.0|debt collector (Student)|mark a loan as returned|know which loans are returned to me.|
|v1.0|new user|know the list of commands|use the app correctly.|
|v2.0|new user|know what function I can use|tell what are the valid inputs for the application.|
|v2.0|lender|know the loanee's punctuality on returning the loan|gauge who to continue lending money the next time.|
|v2.0|student|know how trustworthy a person is according to a score indicator|decide how risk-free it is to lend money to the said person.|

## Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements

---

1. The application should be responsive.
1. The application should work on most operating systems (OS) such as Windows and Linux with `Java 11` installed.
1. Users who can type fast should be able to complete equivalent tasks faster as compared to using a mouse.
1. Users should be able to use the application with ease with the help of the User Guide (UG) and the Developer's Guide (DG).

## Appendix D: Instructions for manual testing

---

{Give instructions on how to do a manual product testing e.g., how to load sample data to be used for testing}
